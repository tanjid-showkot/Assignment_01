            <h2>Reason behind<br> About my Mission</h2>
            <p>I passed higher secondary in 2018 and got admission in Titumir College, one of the seven colleges
                affiliated to Dhaka University. After 2 years of study, in 2021, I realized that this subject will not
                be read by me. Then I enrolled in computer science at a private university and promised to make myself a
                programmer.</p>

            <h2>More About <br>My Mission 2022</h2>
            <p>In addition to being a programmer, I took the mission of studying abroad in 2016. Then I learned German
                to go to German. But due to the lack of complete guidelines, German language is no longer learned. So I
                came abroad in 2022 and took the mission again. Inshallah this time I will succeed in this mission.</p>
